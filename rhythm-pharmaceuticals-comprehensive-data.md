## 1. PRODUCT INFORMATION

### 1.1 IMCIVREE® (setmelanotide) injection

#### Product Overview
- **Generic Name**: Setmelanotide acetate
- **Brand Name**: IMCIVREE®
- **Formulation**: Injectable solution, 10 mg/mL for subcutaneous use
- **FDA Status**: First and only FDA-approved treatment targeting an impaired MC4R pathway in the brain
- **Initial U.S. Approval**: 2020
- **Manufacturer**: Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 222 Berkeley Street, 12th Floor, Boston, MA 02116

#### Approved Indications

IMCIVREE is indicated for chronic weight management in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with:

1. **Obesity due to genetically confirmed:**
   - Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency
   - Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) deficiency
   - Leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency
   - *Note: An FDA-approved test is required to confirm POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency*

2. **Obesity due to Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS)**
   - To help patients lose weight and keep the weight off

#### Mechanism of Action

**Drug Class**: Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonist

**Pharmacology**:
- Setmelanotide is a cyclic anti-obesity drug with biased signaling toward Gq/11
- Binds with high affinity to the human MC4R (inhibitory constant [Ki] = 2.1 nmol/L)
- Efficient in activating MC4R (EC50 = 0.27 nmol/L)
- Approximately 20-fold more potent agonist of MC4R than endogenous α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH)
- Also activates melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) and melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) with 20-fold less activity than MC4R
- Selective over melanocortin-2 receptor (MC2R) and melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5R)

**How It Works**:
- When administered peripherally, setmelanotide crosses the blood-brain barrier
- Acts on the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and lateral hypothalamic area
- These areas are associated with appetite regulation and energy balance
- By binding to MC4R, it replaces the missing link in the hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin pathway
- Results in appetite suppression, improved insulin resistance, and increased energy expenditure
- Effective elimination half-life: approximately 11 hours

#### Dosing and Administration

**Administration Route**: Subcutaneous injection
**Timing**: Once daily, when patient first wakes up
**Food**: Can be given with or without food

**Adults and Patients ≥12 Years (Normal Renal Function)**:
- **Starting dose**: 2 mg (0.2 mL) subcutaneously once daily for 2 weeks
- **Titration**: After 2 weeks, if well-tolerated, increase to 2 mg once daily
- **Optional increase**: If additional weight loss is desired in adults, increase to 2.5 mg once daily
- **Monitoring**: Monitor patients for gastrointestinal adverse reactions during dosage initiation and titration

**Pediatric Patients 2 to <6 Years**:
- **Starting dose**: 0.5 mg once daily subcutaneously for 2 weeks
- **Dose reduction**: If 0.5 mg starting dose is not tolerated, reduce to 0.25 mg (0.025 mL) once daily

**Patients ≥12 Years with Severe Renal Impairment**:
- **Starting dose**: 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) subcutaneously once daily for 2 weeks
- **First titration**: If tolerated for 2 weeks, increase to 1 mg (0.1 mL) once daily
- **Second titration**: If 1 mg daily dose is tolerated for at least 1 week, increase to 1.5 mg (0.15 mL) once daily

#### Contraindications

IMCIVREE is contraindicated in:
- Patients with prior serious hypersensitivity to setmelanotide or any of the excipients
- Neonates or infants (due to benzyl alcohol content which can cause serious and fatal reactions including gasping syndrome)

## 2. DISEASE/CONDITION INFORMATION

### 2.1 The MC4R Pathway

#### Overview
The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway is a key neurosignaling pathway in the hypothalamus responsible for regulating energy balance, hunger, and satiety.

#### Normal MC4R Pathway Function

**The Leptin-Melanocortin-MC4R Signaling Cascade**:

1. **Fed State Signaling**:
   - Circulating hormones (leptin and insulin) are abundant
   - These hormones cross the blood-brain barrier to reach the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus
   - Leptin and insulin bind to receptors on pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons
   - Binding stimulates POMC neurons to process POMC into mature α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)
   - α-MSH is released and binds to MC4R expressed on neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN)
   - MC4R activation results in:
     - Satiety signal (reduced appetite)
     - Increased energy expenditure
     - Reduced energy balance

2. **Starved State Signaling**:
   - Decreased levels of circulating leptin and insulin
   - Increased orexigenic hormone ghrelin
   - Activation of agouti-related neuropeptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-expressing neurons
   - These neurons promote food intake

#### MC4R Pathway Impairment

**Causes of Impairment**:
- Rare gene variants in MC4R pathway genes
- Injury to the hypothalamic region

**Consequences of Impairment**:
- **Impaired or deficient α-MSH production**
- **Hyperphagia**: Pathological, insatiable hunger and impaired satiety accompanied by abnormal food-seeking behaviors
- **Reduced energy expenditure**: Decreased calorie burning
- **Early-onset severe obesity**: Typically occurring at ≤6 years of age

#### Types of MC4R Pathway Obesity

Understanding the root cause of obesity is essential for early diagnosis and optimal disease management. MC4R pathway-associated obesity includes:

1. **Monogenic forms**: Single-gene variants
   - POMC deficiency
   - PCSK1 deficiency
   - LEPR deficiency
   - Other MC4R pathway gene variants

2. **Syndromic forms**:
   - Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS)
   - Alström syndrome

3. **Acquired forms**:
   - Acquired hypothalamic obesity (AHO)

These differ from:
- **General obesity**: Polygenic forms affecting the broader population

### 2.2 Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS)

#### Overview
- **Pronunciation**: "BAR-day BEED-el"
- **Classification**: Rare autosomal recessive disease, ciliopathy, and rare MC4R pathway disease
- **Prevalence**:
  - Europe and North America: 1:100,000 to 1:160,000
  - Kuwait: 1:13,500 (high prevalence community)
  - Newfoundland: 1:17,500 (high prevalence community)

#### Pathophysiology
Dysfunction of the immotile primary cilia in the hypothalamic melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway results in:
- Disruption of energy balance control
- Loss of hunger and satiety regulation
- Severe hyperphagia manifesting in food-seeking behaviors
- Development of obesity early in childhood

#### Clinical Features

**Major Diagnostic Features** (Diagnosis requires 4 of 6 major features, or 3 major + 2 minor):
1. **Rod-cone dystrophy** (retinal dystrophy)
2. **Early-onset severe obesity**
3. **Genital anomalies**
4. **Renal anomalies/dysfunction**
5. **Postaxial polydactyly**
6. **Cognitive impairment/learning difficulties**

**Primary Symptoms**:
- Hyperphagia (present in 68% of BBS cases)
- Early-onset severe obesity (present in 90% of BBS cases)
- Intellectual disability
- Multiple organ system involvement
- Varied symptoms that differ between individuals and change over time

**Diagnosis**:
- Clinical diagnosis based on major and minor features
- Genetic testing recommended to confirm diagnosis
- 80% of patients will have a known genetic etiology for BBS
- Recent data shows median age of diagnosis has improved to 5.8 years
- Most common reason for suspicion: early-onset obesity

#### Hyperphagia in BBS

**Characteristics**:
- Insatiable hunger that leads to abnormal food-seeking behaviors
- Total hyperphagia questionnaire score: 27.6 ± 9.0 in BBS vs. 19.1 ± 7.9 in controls (P = 0.005)

**Behavioral Manifestations**:
- Waking at night to find food
- Consuming food left by others
- Severe cases: sneaking, stealing, or hiding food

**Impact on Quality of Life**:
Evidence suggests hyperphagia and obesity in BBS have broad negative impacts including:
- Physical health complications
- Emotional well-being challenges
- School performance difficulties
- Personal relationship strains

**Onset**: Signs and symptoms occur during early childhood and progress over time, placing substantial, multifaceted burden on patients.

### 2.3 POMC, PCSK1, and LEPR Deficiencies

#### Overview
Rare homozygous or biallelic variants in POMC, PCSK1, and LEPR genes can disrupt signaling through the MC4R pathway, resulting in hyperphagia and severe early-onset obesity.

#### POMC Deficiency (Proopiomelanocortin Deficiency)

**Prevalence in Study Population**: n=31 in natural history study

**Common Characteristics**:
- **Hyperphagia**: Present in 68% of cases
- **Early-onset obesity**: Present in 90% of cases (defined as occurring at ≤6 years of age)
- **ACTH deficiency and hypocortisolism**: 68%
- **Hypoglycemic episodes**: 52%
- **Developmental delays in childhood**: 39%
- **Light or pale skin for ethnicity**: 65%
- **Red hair**: Only 29% (contrary to common belief)

**Diagnosis Requirement**: FDA-approved genetic test required to confirm POMC deficiency

#### PCSK1 Deficiency (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 1 Deficiency)

**Prevalence in Study Population**: n=43 in natural history study

**Common Characteristics**:
- **Gastrointestinal complications in first weeks of life** (usually postnatal diarrhea): 86%
- **Hyperphagia**: Present in 16% of cases
- **Early-onset obesity**: Present in 47% of cases
- **Hyperproinsulinemia**: 65%

**Diagnosis Requirement**: FDA-approved genetic test required to confirm PCSK1 deficiency

#### LEPR Deficiency (Leptin Receptor Deficiency)

**Prevalence in Study Population**: Included in natural history study

**Common Characteristics**:
- **Hyperphagia**: Present in 91% of cases
- **Early-onset obesity**: Present in 97% of cases

**Diagnosis Requirement**: FDA-approved genetic test required to confirm LEPR deficiency

#### Clinical Significance

**Underdiagnosis**: POMC, PCSK1, and LEPR deficiencies may be underdiagnosed because of a lack of awareness of these disorders.

**Importance of Natural History**: Understanding the natural history of POMC, PCSK1, and LEPR deficiencies helps physicians identify patients for genetic testing.

**Treatment**: In 2020, the FDA approved setmelanotide (IMCIVREE) for treatment of patients with biallelic variants in POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR.

### 2.4 Acquired Hypothalamic Obesity (AHO)

#### Definition
Acquired hypothalamic obesity is:
- A disease marked by rapid and persistent weight gain resulting from hypothalamic injury
- An acquired form of accelerated and sustained weight gain that occurs most frequently after hypothalamic damage
- Characterized by rapid weight gain due to hyperphagia and reduced metabolic rate, resulting quickly in morbid obesity

#### Causes
Hypothalamic obesity refers to obesity caused by structural injury to the hypothalamus, which may occur due to:
- **Brain tumor surgery** (most common)
- **Tumors**: Craniopharyngiomas (most common cause), germinomas, gliomas, hamartomas, pituitary adenomas
- **Other hypothalamic injury**

**Craniopharyngioma Statistics**:
- Incidence: 0.5-2.0 new cases per million persons per year
- Craniopharyngioma (and/or its treatment) is now regarded as the most common cause of hypothalamic obesity in humans

#### Prevalence
- Obesity is a common complication after craniopharyngioma therapy, occurring in up to 75% of survivors
- Extremely high frequency of hypothalamic obesity: 30-77% after craniopharyngioma treatment
- In adult-onset craniopharyngioma patients:
  - 19.2% prevalence preoperatively
  - 29.2% prevalence at last follow-up postoperatively

#### Clinical Presentation

**Primary Symptoms**:
- Fatigue
- Decreased physical activity
- Uncontrolled appetite/hyperphagia
- Morbid obesity
- Insulin and leptin resistance

**Six Domains of Clinical Symptoms**:
1. Psychosocial disorders
2. Hyperphagia
3. Sleep disturbances
4. Decreased energy expenditure
5. Hyperinsulinemia
6. Hypopituitarism

**Associated Complications**:
- Cardiovascular disease
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Disturbances of circadian rhythm
- Sleep-disordered breathing
- Metabolic-associated liver disease
- Reduction in functional capacity
- Impaired quality of life
- Increased mortality and morbidities

#### Pathophysiology

**Energy Balance Disruption**:
- Increase in energy intake
- Decrease in sympathetic activity
- Increase in parasympathetic activity

**Mechanism**:
- Inability to transduce afferent hormonal signals of adiposity
- Mimics a state of CNS starvation
- Efferent sympathetic activity drops → malaise and reduced energy expenditure
- Vagal activity increases → increased insulin secretion and adipogenesis

#### Treatment Challenges

**Lifestyle Intervention**:
- Weight gain occurs even with caloric restriction
- Attempts at lifestyle modification are essentially useless to prevent or treat the obesity
- Lifestyle intervention is essentially useless in this syndrome

**Current Treatment Approaches**:
- No treatment algorithms currently available for management of hypothalamic obesity
- Recent efforts focus on developing individualized approaches
- Early and intensive management required to mitigate obesity and negative consequences

**Pharmacologic Treatment**:
- Adrenergics to mimic sympathetic activity
- Octreotide to suppress insulin secretion
- Combination approaches
- **Novel agents**: Setmelanotide has shown promising results

**Surgical Interventions** (variable results):
- Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
- Laparoscopic gastric banding
- Truncal vagotomy
